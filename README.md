# **Kubernetes (K8s)**

## **Introduction**
The biggest difference between Kubernetes and Docker is that the former is a **platform to run and manage containers from many different runtimes** while the latter is a **container runtime itself**[^1]. Meaning that we could use Kubernetes to manage a multitude of Docker containers (orchestration) we have created. Kubernetes will replicate or downsize according to a set of rules.

![Types of Deployment](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/26a177ede4d7b032362289c6fccd448fc4a91174/eb693/images/docs/container_evolution.svg)

Kubernetes is an example of a Container Deployment. When we deploy a Kubernetes instance we have a Cluster that aims to manage a multitude of containers. Some key features[^2]:

* Recover instances as needed (Self-healing, high avaliability)
* Adapt to deeps and peaks of demand
* Offers environment consistency for development, testing, and production

## **Components**
Kubernetes is a little bit more complex than Docker, as expected since it orchestrates Docker containers, requiring more components to achieve that goal.

| **Node** | **Pod** | 
| ----------- | ----------- |
| An **instance of Kubernetes** is called Node, it is a physical, virtual[^3] or cloud machine. Each Node is managed by a control plane[^4]. | Inside Nodes we will find another component called **pod**, which is an **abstraction layer of a container**[^5]. This is where each application is running, each with an IP address generated by Kubernetes. If that app crashes for some reason, we would need to update the IP address manually in our code to make it communicate to each other again. Since that would be cumbersome, there are two other components: Service and Ingress. |

| **Service** | **Ingress** | 
| ----------- | ----------- |
| The **Service** is a static IP address that can be attached to each Pod[^5]. Service and Pod are not linked directly, they can exist separately and as soon as the Pod restarts the Service keeps its IP address static. | Now, **Ingress** is like a DNS server, solving all external requests into its correct Service. It opens the Node to the external world and proxy these requests to the correct Service. |

| **Configmap** | **Secret** | 
| ----------- | ----------- |
| **Configmap** is a component that lists external configuration of our application. With that we can set the database URL inside our app and no matter what the IP address is the database will reside on that particular URL so we don't need to update the application manually[^5]. | We could also add all passwords and users to Configmap. This approach is not safe and thus there's another similar component called **Secret** to achieve that goal. The file is encoded in base64 so it is safer than Configmap. |

### **Volumes**
Another important consequence of crashing containers is related to data. If we have a container with a database (Like MySQL) and it crashes, all data contained in it would be lost. This is why we have Volumes. **Volumes persists content to a physical drive (Local or Remote to the Node)**. K8s doesn't manage data persistance[^5].

| **Deployment** | **StatefulSet** | 
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Component responsible to create the abstraction layer of one or multiple applications (containers). Its content is not saved thus lost when a pod crashes, used to create State**LESS** apps. | Has the same function as Deployment but saves pod's internal data to create a State**FUL** app or Database |

## **Basic Requirements**

To develop this study you need to install Docker, Minikube, and Kubectl. To avoid explaining installation steps for each one of them, I decided to list the links for each application's documentation and you must make sure that they are running smoothly:

* Docker - https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#set-up-the-repository
* Minikube - https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/
* Kubectl - https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/

## **Development Environment**
I personally like to use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as my development software, for these reasons:

* Lightweight like Sublime but very capable due to extensions;
* Very customizable, every settings from every extension can be worked upon to match your needs;
* Supports Git protocol;
* Share your personal settings through GitHub, so all you need to do is load your user and your entire environment is ready;
* These beautifil extensions:
    * Docker: ms-azuretools.vscode-docker
    * Dev Containers: ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers

The first extension will make managing your images and containers (more below) through an UI, making everything easier if you prefer managing that way. 

The Dev Container extension enables us to "develop in production". By that I mean thatwhen you create your project using the extension, it will do all the heavy work of creating the required Docker files, start the container (app, contains a barebones OS within it) and then all VS Code "restarts" but inside the container running. There are advantages to this but I will keep it short and move on.

## **Kubernetes In Practice**

### **Article 01 - Persisting Data In Kubernetes**
In this article we will try to show how to persist data in a Kubernetes cluster. I will cover steps to create a MongoDB cluster with and without a Stateful component so that we can reset both instances and we will see what happens with the data we created. 

<br>

#### **Setup MongoDB deployment & service components**
First we need to setup the actual application by creating a Deployment and Service components. Using VSCode there's a feature that allows us to choose what component we are creating and then it creates the whole template file for you.

```yaml
# mongodb-deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mongodb-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mongodb
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mongodb
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mongodb
        image: mongo
        ports:
        - containerPort: 27017
        env:
        - name: MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: 
              key: 
        - name: MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: 
              key: 
```

This is the basic deployment that would launch a MongoDB pod in our Cluster. 

The empty environmental variables (env section) will be filled in the next section. They are all related to basic authentication of the database and these are stored in a different component (secret).

The environmental variable names were taken from [MongoDB page in DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo) and are require in order that the deployment (pod) can access the service.

<br>

#### **Create MongoDB Secret component**
Create a new file to store the user and password for the DB access. Below you  may find the YAML file:

```yaml
# mongodb-secret.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
    name: mongodb-secret
type: Opaque
data:
    mongo-root-username: Z3JhX2FkbWlu
    mongo-root-password: cGFzc3dvcmQ=
```

To get the root username and password there's an additional step. Remember that any actual information in a secret file must be base64 encoded. To encode in base64 we just need to run the following in the command line:

```$ echo -n <username or password> | base64```

Remember to put the value within '' if there's a space in it. This command will print out the value you requested in base64, paste those values in the corresponding key-value pair (mongo-root-username and mongo-root-password). also important to note that we could use any label for each data point within data section. Just make sure you use the same labels when pasting it back into the Deployment component.

After creating the file, make sure to add the component to your cluster ```$ kubectl apply -f mongo-secret.yaml``` and ```$ kubectl get secret``` to confirm that it was applied to the cluster.

![Secrets](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22838513/201800159-f4b93452-14c0-4ce0-a046-f78709d8a62f.png)

<br>

#### **Add Secret credentials do MongoDB Deployment and Create Service**
Now let's get back to MongoDB Deployment file (In my case mongodb-deployment.yaml) but keep the secret file opened. With the username and password generated in the step above, we can complete the Deployment component.

```yaml
# mongodb-deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mongodb-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mongodb
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mongodb
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mongodb
        image: mongo
        ports:
        - containerPort: 27017
        env:
        - name: MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mongodb-secret # Secret YAML file name
              key: mongo-root-username # Name of the key in data section within Secret YAML file
        - name: MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mongodb-secret
              key: mongo-root-password 
```

Now the Deployment component will access the Secret component directly, and if you want to change the credentials you only need to change the Secret component.

Next we will add the Service component directly in the Deployment component. This is good because we can reduce the number of files in our project since Deployment and Service are almost always created in pairs. 

To achieve that, add a "---" by the end of the current Deployment component and after that we start the Service component section:

```yaml
# Ending of mongodb-deployment.yaml file
        env:
        - name: MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mongodb-secret # Secret YAML file name
              key: mongo-root-username # Name of the key in data section within Secret YAML file
        - name: MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mongodb-secret
              key: mongo-root-password 
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mongodb-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: mongodb
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 27017
      targetPort: 27017 # This port must match above port (container/pod)
```

The ports are also somewhat standardized and can be found in the image's Docker Hub page or everywhere on the internet. With Secret and Service added to the Deployment file and kubcetl, we must now apply the deployment to the cluster:

```$ kubectl apply -f mongodb-deployment.yaml```

We can check the progress by typing ```$ kubectl get pod``` and ```$ kubectl get service```.

<br>

#### **Setup Mongo Express Deployment**
MongoDB is just the database engine that handles queries and data itself. Mongo Express is a container that will give MongoDB a UI, making it easier to manage database and data. This will also help us test the persistant state of the database (or not) in the next steps.

Let's create a file much like mongodb-deployment.yaml:

```yaml
# mongo-express-deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mongo-express
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mongo-express
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mongo-express
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mongo-express
        image: mongo-express
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8081
        env:
        - name: ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINUSERNAME
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name:
              key: 
        - name: ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINPASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name:
              key:
        - name: ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_SERVER
          valueFrom: 
            configMapKeyRef:
              name:
              key:
```

Just like what happened with MongoDB deployment, we need to gather three environmental variables from DockerHub. We need the admin username/password and the server where MongoDB is being hosted for Mongo Express to access it. To make it easier, we will also use the same secret as MongoDB.

The last environmental variable requires a ConfigMap, since we need to setup a URL for MongoDB pods.

<br>

#### **Create MongoDB ConfigMap**
Now we must create a file called ```mongodb-configmap.yaml`` and add the following information:

```yaml
# mongodb-configmap.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: mongodb-configmap
data:
  database_url: mongodb-service
```

Since we are not deploying it online, the URL is going to be the service that is providing Mongo DB. This is why we have the service name as URL. Now we must apply this component to our cluster:

```$ kubectl apply -f mongodb-configmap.yaml```

<br>

#### **Add ConfigMap and Service to Mongo-Express Deployment**
With

```yaml
# Ending of mongo-express-deployment.yaml file
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8081
        env:
        - name: ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINUSERNAME
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mongodb-secret
              key: mongo-root-username
        - name: ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINPASSWORD
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: mongodb-secret
              key: mongo-root-password
        - name: ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_SERVER
          valueFrom: 
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: mongodb-configmap
              key: database_url
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mongo-express-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: mongo-express
  type: LoadBalancer # This make the service externally available
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 8081
      targetPort: 8081
      nodePort: 30000 # This is the external port that will be exposed
```
After completing the rest of the ```mongo-express-deployment.yaml```, we must apply that to our cluster: ```$ kubectl apply -f mongo-express-deployment.yaml```.

Now we have all necessary components to test what happens when we **don't** have the necessary components to persist data. Let's double check if all components are installed:

![kubectl get all](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22838513/201800204-f4dd4f81-53b1-40d7-a3a8-8f7075d9cef6.png)

In the above picture we may see - in order - **2 running pods (STATUS = RUNNING)**, **3 services (Kubernetes, mongo-express, and mongodb-deployment)**, **2 deployments**, and **2 replicaset**.

To verify the ports we could use ```$ kubectl get service```:

![Services](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22838513/201800224-28f74670-7f3a-4afa-bb2d-63ece7a0bfcc.png)

<br>

#### **Making Mongo Express Service available**
Minikube is a bit different than regular Kubernetes in this aspect. When you listed the Services, the Mongo Express Service won't have an external IP yet. To achieve that we have to run the following command:

```$ minikube service mongo-express-service```

Your Browser might open up after running this command, in my case it indicated that I was using Docker inside Linux and thus I should copy the address and paste it to my Browser:

![minikube service](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22838513/201800306-891ab5ca-e2a3-4896-b074-fddc8d2e7bf1.png)

![Mongo Express](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22838513/201800359-2397b916-f170-4580-a298-9988fab69c80.png)

<br>

#### **Testing data persistance**
With the service running, create a database with any name so we can test what happens when we reset the database pod.

![test-db](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22838513/201800379-e63bed74-335c-4511-bdc0-20e60bb5a4e6.png)


With the database created, let's restart the pod. There's no official way to do that within Kubernetes, we will scale the pods to 0 and back to 1 so we "reset" its state.

1) Reduce Replicas to 0: ```$ kubectl scale deployment mongodb-deployment --replicas=0```
2) Confirm that there's no instance of mongodb-deployment running: ```$ kubectl get deployment```
3) Increase Replicas back to 1: ```$ kubectl scale deployment mongodb-deployment --replicas=1```
4) Refresh your browser and check if the database we created (test-db) is gone.

</br>

### **Article 02 - How data "travels" between containers inside a pod**
This topic is a bit more complex and not that "useful" - lack of a better word. This will require monitoring the network for packages and is very specific to debug some solutions.



[namespace]

https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/kubernetes-pod-network-communications
https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/kubernetes-pods-communicate-nodes


### **Article 03 - Helm**
Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes, much like the apt command in Linux. Instead of developing abunch of YAML files for all applications, other developers bundle them up into Helm Charts so that we can download it and use in our applications more quickly.

It can also work as a template engine, so that we will have templates and within these template YAML files we can change the placeholders "on the fly" which is a great feature when we have a Continuous Development scenario.

There're several ways to install Helm, make sure you [go to this link](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/#from-apt-debianubuntu) and verify the required steps to install Helm. For Ubuntu, I used the following commands:

```
$ curl https://baltocdn.com/helm/signing.asc | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/helm.gpg > /dev/null
$ sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https --yes
$ echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/helm.gpg] https://baltocdn.com/helm/stable/debian/ all main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/helm-stable-debian.list
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install helm
```

Run ``$ helm`` command to confirm that it was installed. If it was successful, we will now install a MongoDB using Helm.

We will build a Node.js application with MongoDB through Helm. This will also enable us to see persistance and replication of data. This article[^7] was used to develop this section, which was very helpful to understand how to verify if data was replicated throughout database instances.

##### **Cloning Application**
The following command will clone the application repository to a folder called ``article_03``. It will pull all the required files including those needed to create Helm Charts.

```$ git clone https://github.com/do-community/node-mongo-docker-dev.git article_03```

This Helm Chart will create:
* A StatefulSet object with three Pods, this is our distributed and failproof database.
* MongoDB replica with one master and two secondary pods. Data is stored in the first and replicated to the secondary pods.

To make the connection between MongoDB pods, MongoDB uses a URI with all connection information. Currently, the file ``db.js`` contains constants and wouldn't allow us to have multiple replicas. Add the following to ```db.js```.

```javascript
// db.js
...
const {
  MONGO_USERNAME,
  MONGO_PASSWORD,
  MONGO_HOSTNAME,
  MONGO_PORT,
  MONGO_DB,
  MONGO_REPLICASET // Add this
} = process.env;

...
const url = `mongodb://${MONGO_USERNAME}:${MONGO_PASSWORD}@${MONGO_HOSTNAME}:${MONGO_PORT}/${MONGO_DB}?replicaSet=${MONGO_REPLICASET}&authSource=admin`; // Edit this connection string
...
```

We added ``MONGO_REPLICASET`` constant to the ``process.env`` variable and to the connection string (``url``). With this we will pass the Replica address alongside the other parameters.

Before we build a Docker image, delete ```package-lock.json``` and change the Dockerfile first line:

```Dockerfile
FROM node:18.12.1-alpine

RUN mkdir -p /home/node/app/node_modules && chown -R node:node /home/node/app

WORKDIR /home/node/app

COPY package*.json ./

USER node

RUN npm install

COPY --chown=node:node . .

EXPOSE 8080

CMD [ "node", "app.js" ]
```

Theses changes were made to ensure that we are using a current version of Node.js. Now we build the image locally and push it to our DockerHub repository:

```$ docker build -t your_dockerhub_username/article-03-node-replicas .```

After build ran successful, push this image to your DockerHub repo, in my case:

```$ docker push vitorcmonteiro/article-03-node-replicas```

![Docker push to Docker Hub](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22838513/208545954-33dbac92-e308-49ae-a181-3d96f6268570.png)


#### **Configure MongoDB Helm Chart and Create Deployment**
For this step we will take advantage of the templating mentioned before. We must create a file called ``mongodb-values.yaml`` that will serve as the values that will be inserted into the Helm Chart template.

First, we create a key for the ReplicaSet:

```$ openssl rand -base64 756 > key.txt``` and add that to the cluster like we did with the secret ```$ kubectl create secret generic keyfilesecret --from-file=key.txt```. Since we already created MongoDB's secret for admin access, we will have two secrets.

![Secrets saved in Cluster](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22838513/208545996-3fa01317-5166-45d1-bf95-c52b8352a0bb.png)


After that we can create the ``mongodb-values.yaml`` file. This file is needed in order to configure the Helm package we are installing and acts as a template.

```yaml
# mongdb-values.yaml
architecture: replicaset
replicaCount: 3
persistence:
  size: 1Gi
replicaSetName: db
auth:
  existingKeySecret: keyfilesecret
  existingAdminSecret: mongodb-secret
```
Now we will install MongoDB using Helm (instead of creating all files like we did in article 01):

```$ helm repo add mongodb https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami```<br>
```$ helm repo list```<br>
```$ helm install mongodb -f mongodb-values.yaml mongodb/mongodb```

![Helm installation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22838513/208546022-55175695-69f6-4e01-b4c4-d7b72f4c735a.png)

Just by running these commands we will have a running pod named helm-mongodb, check that by running ``$ kubectl get pod``:

![Pods running](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22838513/208546072-2ab23b28-1883-4853-b009-fe3d27d88d56.png)

Now that the pods are running, we have a MongoDB installed and running in multiple instances. Next up we are going to create our own Helm package instead of using a Bitnami's or someone elese's repository.

#### **Creating Custom Application Chart and Parameters**
At the root level of the project, create a new Helm repository:

```$ helm create nodeapp```

This command will create a folder called ``nodeapp`` and with a bunch of files in it. To explain a few important ones.

* Chart.yaml - Basic information about the Chart.
* values.yaml - Set of specific parameters.
* templates/ - Contains all template files that will generate Kubernetes components.
* charts/ - Contains any charts that this chart depends on.

First we will edit values.yaml to match the image we created at the first step.

```yaml
# values.yaml
# Default values for nodeapp.
# This is a YAML-formatted file.
# Declare variables to be passed into your templates.

replicaCount: 3 # Here

image:
  repository: vitorcmonteiro/node-replicas # Here
  tag: latest # Here
  pullPolicy: IfNotPresent

nameOverride: ""
fullnameOverride: ""

service:
  type: LoadBalancer # Here
  port: 80
  targetPort: 8080 # Add this line
...
```

Why are we doing this? Well, remember that the first step consisted in creating an image that would pull Node.js image and run it as a web-server (Take a look at the Dockerfile). So every time we want to increase the replica amount, it will run that image and launch a pod (container) in minikube.

What's very interesting and concerning is that many application nowadays are currently pointing to someone's github as their helm repository and this could potentially break apps all around the globe if that person decides to delete that repo.

Now create a file called ``secret.yaml`` in the ``templates`` folder and insert the following:

```yaml
# secret.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: {{ .Release.Name }}-auth
data:
  MONGO_USERNAME: Z3JhX2FkbWlu
  MONGO_PASSWORD: cGFzc3dvcmQ
```

The USERNAME and PASSWORD came from the very first secret file we created, base64-encoded. This secret will replicate for each Node pod that Kubernet launches, guaranteeing that all instances have access to the database. Remember that there's another component called ConfigMap where we stored all variables for each deployment.

Create a ``configmap.yaml`` file inside the ``templates`` folder and add the following:

```yaml
# configmap.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:

### **Article 04 - Envoy**
Envoy is a type of load balancing technology created at Lyft. There are several other options like NGINX, HAProxy, Zuul, Linkerd, Traefik, and Caddy (Go) [^8]. It's important to note that depending on the engine used in the cloud service this tutorial may not work.

#### **Create headless service**

```yaml
# envoy_service.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: myapp
spec:
  clusterIP: None
  ports:
  - name: http
    port: 80
    targetPort: http
    protocol: TCP
  selector:
    app: myapp
```

#### **Create Envoy Docker Image**

#### **Create Envoy Deployment**

#### **Test if it's working**

#### **Create Grafana Deployment, Service, and PVC**
To deploy Grafana to our solution is quite straightforward and repeats what we have done before. We will create a Deployment, a Service, and a PVC (Remember, we have data to be persisted right now). I used Grafana's own documentation for that[^10]. Since all three components need each other for Grafana to work, let's just create one file.

```yaml
# grafana.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: grafana-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    app: grafana
  name: grafana
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: grafana
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: grafana
    spec:
      securityContext:
        fsGroup: 472
        supplementalGroups:
          - 0
      containers:
        - name: grafana
          image: grafana/grafana:9.1.0
          imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
          ports:
            - containerPort: 3000
              name: http-grafana
              protocol: TCP
          readinessProbe:
            failureThreshold: 3
            httpGet:
              path: /robots.txt
              port: 3000
              scheme: HTTP
            initialDelaySeconds: 10
            periodSeconds: 30
            successThreshold: 1
            timeoutSeconds: 2
          livenessProbe:
            failureThreshold: 3
            initialDelaySeconds: 30
            periodSeconds: 10
            successThreshold: 1
            tcpSocket:
              port: 3000
            timeoutSeconds: 1
          resources:
            requests:
              cpu: 250m
              memory: 750Mi
          volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /var/lib/grafana
              name: grafana-pv
      volumes:
        - name: grafana-pv
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: grafana-pvc
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: grafana
spec:
  ports:
    - port: 3000
      protocol: TCP
      targetPort: http-grafana
  selector:
    app: grafana
  sessionAffinity: None
  type: LoadBalancer
```

Now follow these two simple steps:
* Apply the file we just created: ``$ kubectl apply -f grafana.yaml``. 
* Open its port so we can access through the browser: ``$ kubectl port-forward service/grafana 3000:3000``.
* Use ``admin`` for both username and password.

1. Create Namespace
2.
